## Overview
The Visualize-of-space-data project is aimed at applying data processing and visualization methods in the context of space research. The goal of the project is to use real-world space datasets to analyze and create visual representations that contribute to a better understanding of space phenomena and objects.
A file project_proposals(1)(1) can be used to see more detailes.

## Checkpoint 1
- The star_visualization folder contains files to visualize stars. The info.json file is the main source of data for analysis. The visualisation is available at the link: 
https://dzhamiliafatkullina.github.io/starVisualization/. It can be also watched on the vis_record.mp4 file (to watch need to download).
- The data folder contains the script that was used to scrape and retrieve data from the API. 
- The main goal for the next phase is to improve visualisation, add interactive features and work with graphs for more convenient data analysis.

## Checkpoint 2
- Graphs were added using d3.js.
- The design of the info panels was improved.
- The main goals for the next phase are:
  - to improve visualization, namely adding planets and their characteristics; in addition, it is possible to consider adding visualization of the distance to a particular planet or star from any object.
  - make docker file
